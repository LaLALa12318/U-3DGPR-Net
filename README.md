# U-3DGPR-Net
  This is a data example of the paper “U-3DGPR-Net: An algorithm for the 3D reconstruction of underground targets using 3D GPR data”. It shows the road model and B-Scan profiles of underground cavities, pipelines and underground layer in detail. 
  
  In each folder, there is a set of 3D GPR data and a Target txt of underground dielectric constants. At the same time, there is a code for converting a png image to a gprMax-readable h5 file.  The materials folder is provided to represent the material parameters of the subsurface medium for five different geologic environments. Since the radar data used in the article is too large, the “.in” file of the gprMax simulation process is also provided, so that the researcher can obtain a large amount of realistic GPR data by using the above information and examples.
  
  Manuscript data details will be updated as they are accepted and GPR data will continue to be uploaded. We welcome researchers to cite this paper, and paper information will be updated as it is accepted.
